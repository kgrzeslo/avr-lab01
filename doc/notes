debian lenny version of KiCad does not have lots of libraries installed.
There is a need to obtain them from another source and put into the libraries.

important note:
to have the funcitonality of changing direction of the snake in lab 3 following needs to be done:
1. put a variable into RAM and initialize it in the Reset subroutine
2. direction of snake depends on the value of the variable
3. main loop for keys change the value of the variable
4. subroutine for lab3 should read the value of this variable each time the subroutine turns on the first LED
5. therefore we can distinguish functionality of menu and key bindiings and make the key not having influence on other labs.
