This project is a summary of some laboratories on AVR microcontrollers made during my studies. The schematics file was created with ExpressSCH. This project should have 6 or 7 different functional parts. On the laboratories we were learning how to use ports, counters, LCD display and all of the tasks should work. I would like to implement some more functionality to switch between the tasks with the keyboard and display the task number and description on the LCD.
